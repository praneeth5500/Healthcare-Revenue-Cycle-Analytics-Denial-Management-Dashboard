# Healthcare-Revenue-Cycle-Analytics-Denial-Management-Dashboard
Built an end-to-end healthcare analytics pipeline to evaluate operational performance and revenue trends across medical departments. Developed a Python-based ETL workflow (Pandas) to clean, validate, and transform 55,000+ patient encounter records before loading into Snowflake for scalable reporting.

Performed advanced SQL analysis to calculate operational KPIs such as Length of Stay (LOS), admission trends, department-level revenue performance, and billing efficiency metrics. Identified bottlenecks in urgent asthma cases where LOS exceeded baseline benchmarks by 0.3 days.

Designed interactive Power BI dashboards to track $1.4B+ in revenue data across six medical segments, enabling stakeholders to monitor department utilization, revenue distribution, and performance trends.
